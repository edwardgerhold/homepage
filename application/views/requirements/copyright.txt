* Edward´s Homepage is originally developed for
* http://linux-swt.de (c) 2014 Edward Gerhold
* This is free and open source software for you.
*
* The Homepage Application Framework bases on the
* "Pro PHP MVC" Framework from the namely equal book
* by Chris Pitt released by http://apress.com.
*
* The application is Edward´s Homepage.
*
* It is some independent work, started somewhere
* in Berlin, Germany, in July 2014 by Edward Gerhold
* for his Homepage. He thought about rewriting it,
* but not without telling the world what his code
* bases on. The greatest PHP MVC Framework in a book
* ever. And not without loading it into a PHPStorm
* evaluation copy from http://jetbrains.com for
* the ultimate experience.

/*
*                                    First i typed
* down the whole framework, then i copied the code
* of the remaining demo application files together.
* This was a good start to get into the framework.
* It has a Registry, Configuration, Session, Data-
* base, Router, Controller, Model, View, Template,
* with serious factory methods for drivers with
* consistent interfaces, a base class with magic
* getters and setters and a property inspector each
* instance. The property inspector reads comments
* and interprets @read, @write, @readwrite for the
* protected attributes for the magic getters and
* setters. But also @column and @type text or
* @validate handler[ handler] or @label identifier
* for Model ORM and validation with messages behind
* the label to tell the developer or the user what
* went wrong. It interpretes @protected for the
* Controller functions. @protected commented methods
* will not be routed.
