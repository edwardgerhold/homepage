# homepage
A copy of the unfinished and interrupted homepage implementation with the Pro PHP MVC framework (apress, book by C.Pitt with modern namespace php with autoloading)

Best is, you get Pro PHP MVC first.
With the book you understand this collection at once.
It´s not much further developed, coz i stopped soon again.
But i wanted to put that here last year, now it is here.
That´s prooving that the book teaches even non-programmers 
how to do php oop with autoloading classes from subdirectories
how to use design factory hierarchies
how to write cache, session, database drivers,
yes. the sql driver is close to perfection.
i missed adding nosql, coz i run none nowhere.
but you can. just get the book from apress and code down.
When typing his code down i learned how it works...
This will be continued someday.
